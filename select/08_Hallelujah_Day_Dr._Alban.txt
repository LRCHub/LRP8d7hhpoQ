Hallelujah day
Hallelujah day
Before I die, I will never lose my race
Before I go, I will never lose you girl
Even though you gone, I will never lose my rage
Even when you come, I will hold on to my words
Hallelujah day
Hallelujah day
Hallelujah day
Hallelujah day
Hallelujah da-ay
Hallelujah da-ay

Before Jah come, I will always be the same
Before Jah come, I will surely be the same
I will never change, for anybody in this world
When Jah Jah come, I can be as clean as him
Jah Jah will come hey
Jah Jah will come
If you no say today is hallelujah day
And all wrongdoers shall get their reward
The heaven is closed for the evildoers (follow me now)
Jah Jah will come hey Jah Jah will come hey
Jah Jah will come (follow me now)
Jah Jah will come
If you no say today is hallelujah day
And all wrongdoers shall get their rewards
