I heard it on the radio
On my way back home
That I'm gonna be someone
I guess it was a song they wrote
Saying don't go slow
'Cause you're gonna be someone

They were singing hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home

Somedays I don't think my momma thinks I'm good
Enough to be a superstar
But one day I will show her I'm a diamond
In the rough, I'll be a superstar

'Cause there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it, whether you like it or not
Yeah, there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it, whether you like it or not

And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not

And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not

Somedays I don't think my daddy thinks
I'm good enough to be a superstar
But one day I will show him I'm a diamond
In the rough, I'll be a superstar

'Cause there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it, whether you like it or not
Yeah, there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it, whether you like it or not

And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not
And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not

I heard it on the radio
On my way back home
That I'm gonna be someone
I guess it was a song they wrote
Saying don't go slow
'Cause you're gonna be someone

They were singing hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home

And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not
And I'll be singing
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not

Whether you like it or not
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not
