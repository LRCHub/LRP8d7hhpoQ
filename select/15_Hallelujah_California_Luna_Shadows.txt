They say:""sit in the sun enough
Your hair's gonna lighten up""
It's true
I drove to Silverlake and parked my car
Ran around the reservoir
Found proof
Now everyday is summertime
Los Angeles if you'll be mine
Then I'll stay lonely, only for you
Meet me on the east side
We can taste the sweet life
Silver screens
Take it to the west side
Breaking in the best high
Vitamin D 'til we bleed
Daddy always warned that
The saddest songs are major keys
Hallelujah California
California
So come kick it down on Saturn's rings
Observatory empty wings with me
Then we'll roll to origami record night
Talk about our vinyl lives
Emily lends a beat
For all the cherry cola pin up queens
Boulevard of broken dreams
It's fucked up as seen on TV
Meet me on the east side
We can taste the sweet life
Silver screens
Take it to the west side
Breaking in the best high
Vitamin D 'til we bleed
Daddy always warned that
The saddest songs are major keys
Hallelujah California
California
(Vitamin D 'til we bleed)
Meet me on the east side
We can taste the sweet life
Silver screens
Take it to the west side
Breaking in the best high
Vitamin D 'til we bleed
Daddy always warned that
The saddest songs are major keys
Hallelujah California
California
