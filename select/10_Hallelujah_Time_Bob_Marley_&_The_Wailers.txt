Hear the children cryin'
But I know they cry not in vain
For now the times are changin'
Love bud's come to bloom again

Smelling the air, when sprinkled by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days
But now it's not rain, that water the cane crops
But the sweat from man's brow
The substance from our spine
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time

Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time! As they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time! Ooh, hallelujah
Singing in the morning (singing)
Hallelujah time! Let them sing, don't you let them cry

Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around
Over hills and valleys
They are everywhere to be found
But though we bear our burdens now
All afflictions got to end somehow
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough
Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free, like birds in a tree

Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time! As they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time! Ooh, hallelujah
Singing in the morning (singing)
Let them sing; never let them cry
Hallelujah time! Hallelujah, singin' in the morning
Hallelujah time! Ooh, hallelujah, singing by and by...
