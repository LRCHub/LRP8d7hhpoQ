[00:04.28] Now I've heard there was a secret chord
[00:08.77] That David played, and it pleased the Lord
[00:12.94] But you don't really care for music, do you?
[00:21.37] It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
[00:25.88] The minor falls, the major lifts
[00:30.39] The baffled king composing Hallelujah
[00:48.89] 
[00:37.43] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[00:46.14] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[00:57.14] 
[00:59.99] Your faith was strong but you needed proof
[01:04.27] You saw her bathing on the roof
[01:08.43] Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
[01:16.67] She tied you to a kitchen chair
[01:21.13] She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
[01:25.06] And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
[01:46.06] 
[01:32.81] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[01:41.47] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[01:52.47] 
[02:19.64] Well, maybe there's a God above
[02:19.96] As for me all I've ever learned from love
[02:20.27] Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
[02:20.51] But it's not a crime that you're hear tonight
[02:20.90] It's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the Light
[02:23.23] No, it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah
[02:47.73] 
[02:27.43] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[02:38.58] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[02:49.92] Instrumental
[02:55.92] 
[02:50.53] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[02:51.74] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:02.74] 
[02:52.34] Well people I've been here before
[02:54.20] I know this room and I've walked this floor
[02:55.10] You see I used to live alone before I knew ya
[02:57.79] And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
[02:59.26] But listen love, love is not some kind of victory march, no
[03:21.67] It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
[03:41.67] 
[03:22.24] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:35.35] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[03:46.35] 
[04:15.14] There was a time you let me know
[04:15.43] What's really going on below
[04:15.77] But now you never show it to me, do you?
[04:16.08] And I remember when I moved in you
[04:16.31] And the holy dove she was moving too
[04:16.55] And every single breath we drew was Hallelujah
[04:39.55] 
[04:16.80] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:17.18] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:28.18] 
[04:17.47] Now I've done my best, I know it wasn't much
[04:18.07] I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
[04:18.37] I've told the truth, I didnt come here to London just to fool you
[04:18.94] And even though it all went wrong
[04:19.20] I'll stand right here before the Lord of song
[04:19.44] With nothing, nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
[04:43.94] 
[04:20.40] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:21.33] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:22.23] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:23.05] Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[04:34.05] 
[04:24.25] Hallelujah
